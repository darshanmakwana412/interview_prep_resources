# Interview Preparation Resources

## Resume

Start making your resume very early on. It not only gives you an edge but also helps you reflect on your accomplishments and unfortunately your shortcomings. Create multiple drafts and iterate upon them after taking feedback from seniors

- **Projects/Open Source Contributions**: These are commonly asked about in tech interviews because they demonstrate your technical knowledge and your ability to explain complex topics to non-experts. Be sure to understand every detail of the projects youâ€™ve worked on.
- **Performance Improvements/Trade-offs**: Explicitly mention the performance improvements or downsides of using a particular framework/method compared to others. This not only strengthens your points but also makes your points more credible and persuasive. For example a point about using Cython in a framework can be written as

    `Used Cython for leveraging efficient and fast indexing of C which resulted in 800% increase in performance`

## Interviews

Prepare a good self-introduction and questions to ask at the end of the interview. Spend time crafting an excellent introduction and some thoughtful questions before the interview.

Ask seniors to conduct mock interviews or participate in NTP organized by SARC.

### LeetCode Resources

While solving problems, focus on the variety of ways to solve each problem rather than the difficulty.
